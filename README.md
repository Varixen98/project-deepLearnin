<h1>Brain Tumor Detection</h1>
<p>
This is a university project for deep learning course.
<br>
The model consist of YOLO11nano + Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) + Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (SPPF).
The dataset that were used to train the model is from:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14318">BRISC: Annotated Dataset for Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification</a>.
<br>
For refference, article:

<h2>Web APP</h2>
<P>
For the web app code Frontend + Backend is in the my-app folder.
</br>
The Model was exported using ONNX and it is placed in folder my-app/api/model.
<br>
In addition, the model is deployed on Render.com using FastAPI framework.
<br>
The web app ui is handled by Next.js framework using react and it is deployed on Vercel.com.
